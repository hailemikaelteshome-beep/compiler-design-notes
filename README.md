# Compiler Design Notes & Lab Work

🎓 This repository contains my **learning notes, explanations, diagrams, and practical lab work** related to **Compiler Design**, prepared as part of my Computer Science studies.

The main goal of this repository is to **understand how a high-level programming language is translated into machine-level instructions** through different phases of a compiler.

## 📘 About Compiler Design

Compiler Design is a core subject in Computer Science that focuses on the principles, techniques, and tools used to build compilers. A compiler translates source code written in a high-level language (such as C or Java) into machine code or intermediate code that a computer can execute.

This repository covers both **theoretical concepts** and **practical examples** to make learning easier and more effective.
